<!--1.Semantic HTML is the way of marking up HTML so that it is readable for web browsers and developers
alike accurately and legibly
    2.Block elemetns always start on a new line as inline elements do not!
    3.The four areas are Margin, Border, Padding, and Content
    4.The cross axis?
    5.Git is extremely important as it allows developers to work on a single project together but
  doing so on separate parts while submitting push and pull requests and forking their work, not 
  affecting the original copy if they were to do something negative to it or on the other hand, if 
  they found a bug and fixed it, they could push that to the repo!-->
