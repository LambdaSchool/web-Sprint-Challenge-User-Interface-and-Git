If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students,
 what would you say?

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, 
or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather 
than merely to define its presentation or look. 
it introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. 
For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. 

Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

. display: block means that the element is displayed as a block,
 as paragraphs and headers have always been.
 
.  Takes up the full width available, with a new line before and after 

 . display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, 
 inside the current block on the same line. 

 .Takes up only as much width as it needs,
  and does not force new lines (display:inline;)
