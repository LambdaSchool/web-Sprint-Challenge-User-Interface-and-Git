1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

  -- It is valuable, because there are many independent versions of a single project. Everyone makes commits, so changes are marked and also it is possible to come back to a specific step; there is a history of the steps. By making own branches, the main code is not changed, but there are many versions of work.
